# Bluetooth
#card
- Bluetooth is a **collection of protocols** that are a **cable replacement technology** (pc, headphones, printers) that implement a personal area network
	- Lower cost and lower power consumption than [[IEEE 802.11]]
- It was more successful with smartphones
- Limited coverage (one room) up to 10 meters
- Slow versions because it's not a replacement of [[Wi-Fi]], nowadays high speed versions uses [[Wi-Fi]] inside
^1623395938373

## Versions
#card
- 3.0, uses a parallel [[IEEE 802.11]] channel to increase up to 24 Mbps, that is negotiated with Bluetooth
- 4.0 in 2010, defines: classic Bluetooth, high speed Bluetooth and low energy Bluetooth (i.e. BLE ~1 Mbps)
- 5.0 in 2016, BLE with burst up to 2Mbps (important for IoT) and increase capacity for connectionless services (location relevant navigation)
^1623395938395

Applications
#card
- cable replacement (original idea)
- sync devices (e.g. smartbands)
- access to the internet
- mobile social networking (e.g. Immuni or crowd sensing in general)
^1623395938414

## Architecture
#card
![[bluetooth architecture.png]]
- Host controller interface between hw/sw
- **One host** (logical layer), while **one or more controllers** for the physical layer for the different bluetooth versions
	- A bluetooth card contains the controller + L2CAP (logical link control and adaption protocol)
- Protocols (core in **bold**, others are adopted)
- **Physical layer** defines
	- **Radio**, frequencies
	- **Baseband**, low level procedures
- **Data Link layer** defines the **setup and controller**
	- Lower part

		- **LLP** (link layer protocol for BLE)
	- Upper part
		- **L2CAP** (Logical Link Control and Adaptation): higher-level protocol multiplexing (package segmentation)
- **Application layer**
	- Telephony AT, TCS
	-  Management/discovery
		- **SDP** for service discovery
		- SMP, ATT/GATT (kind of a 1small [[ZigBee]] cluster library)
	- RFCOMM emulates serial port for cable replacement
 
^1623395938434

### Controllers
#card
- Basic rate (headphones for smartphone)
- Low Energy
- Alternate MAC, for high speed transport link [[IEEE 802.11]] (2 Mbps -> 24 Mbps)
^1623395938453

#### Basic rate or Enhanced data rate
#card
- Operates at 2.4Ghz like  [[IEEE 802.15.4]] and [[IEEE 802.11]]
- 1Mbps for BR, 3Mbps for EDR
- Forms a **piconet**: group of devices synchronized to a common clock and **frequency hopping pattern** #todo
	- Bluetooth BR/EDR is **connection oriented**, so piconet must be formed before, in order to communicate
- Logical links transport **synchronous** (like [[IEEE 802.15.4]]), **asynchronous** and **isochronous** data (start async and then for a period sync)
	- Synchronization is used to ensure low energy for BLE, because it's required at mac level and using sniff mode
- BR uses at peak 25mA
^1623395938472

#### Low Energy (LE)
#card
- Compared to [[#Basic rate Enhanced data rate]]
	- smaller packets to reduce TX/RX power consumption
	- less channels for discovery and connection (searching over a smaller n)
	- simpler state machine
	- used to **expose the state** rather than transferring
- Frequency division multiple access (FDMA) over 40 physical channels + Time
division multiple access (TDMA).
- Physical channel divided with **advertising** and **connection** events, namely frame and its response
- other
	- latency 3ms
	- topology star
	- connections > 2billion
	- range 150m
^1623395938480

##### Powe consumption
#card
- less than 20mA at peak with an average of less than 5Î¼A
	- even devices with coin cell battery!
^1623395938489

##### Speed
#card
- up to 1Mbps nominal, but in reality for the overhead it's smaller
^1623395938497

### Topology
#card
It's the piconet, formed by master and slaves
- **1 Master** than enforces the **synchronization** to enable the communication of the slaves, by **controlling the access** to the channels of the **slaves**
	- roles are not fixed
	- hence slaves can only communicate when the master says so
- Types
	- Point to point
	- Point to multipoint     
- BR/EDR
	-  Up to 7 slaves in a piconet, but other can be in **parked mode** to keep in sync with the master.
- LE   
	- No limit to active slaves in a piconet
	- Just in one piconet
^1623395938506

#### Scatternet
#card
![[bluetooth scatternet.png]]
- piconets share the same frequencies
- to extend the range by doing multi-hop communication
- there is no routing protocol defined by the standard
- no useful applications
^1623395938515

#### BR/EDR example
#card #exam 
![[bluetooth br edr topology.png]]
- Several piconets in an area
- A is the master, the other slaves
	- They can use different low level mechanism
- F is master, the other slaves
	- H is temporarily **deep low power mode** maybe using the sniff state
- E is a slave both in the piconet of A and F, so it need to keep in sync with both in different time
- D is a slave in A but a master in his piconet with J
- K is not connected to any piconet but scanning for it in order to communicate
- Slaves cannot communicate point to point, but need to pass through the master
^1623395938524

#### LE example
#card #exam
![[bluetooth le topology.png]]
- communication
	-  connection-oriented channels (grey one)
		- acts like the master in BR/EDR, so the master A will enforce the sync of the slaves B and C by telling them when to communicate
	- connection-less advertising channels, transparent
		-  D is an **advertiser**, that is not being connected to a piconet but emitting periodically beacons to expose the state to any device in range that is scanning, in this case A is a **scanner**.
		- Be aware that D is not a slave, because there is no connection
		- I, H, J are not in a piconet, but they are advertising/scanners or just one of it.
^1623395938532

### Layers

#### Bluetooth radio layer (physical)
#card
defines the specification of the **radio frequencies**
^1623395938541

##### BR/EDR
#card
![[bluetooth frequency hopping spectrum.png]]
- it operates in the 2.4GHz **frequency band** with a range of 83 MHz
physical channel (synchronized to a common clock and hopping sequence).
- the frequency band is divided in sub-bands of 1MHz, obtaining 79 **physical channels**
- the master defines a pseudo-random sequence
- every time a frame needs to be transmitted, the next channel is computed (**hopping**) and the radio is set to transfer over that frequency band (channel).
	- there are 1600 hops/seconds
^1623395938550

Why it doesn't conflict with [[ZigBee]]?
#card #question 
- sub-bands in [[ZigBee]] are just 16, wider, and it stays always on the same channel
- if overlap with Bluetooth, there is change that one of the network is in low-power mode
- different encoding, so noise it's observed and then discarded
^1623395938560

##### LE
#card
![[bluetooth frequency hopping le.png]]
- 40 channels
	- frequency hopping only in the first 37 channels used for **connection oriented** (master/slave)
	- 37, 38, 39 for connection, discovery and broadcast (search O(3) rather than O(40)), used by **advertisers** to emit beacon and by **scanners** for listening
^1623395938570

##### Transmission power
#low-priority
- class 1: Tx power < 20 dBm (100 mW)
	- Long range (100 m);
- class 2: Tx power < 4 dBm (2.5 mW)
	- Normal range (10 m);
- class 3: Tx power < 0 dBm (1 mW)
	- Short range (10 cm).

#### Baseband layer (physical)
#card #low-priority
It creates the **abstraction of physical channel** that is the pseudo-random sequence, each piconet with a different sequence
- the slave connects and receive the sequence from the master that syncs the hop (frequencies) and the time
- Frequency hopping management (FH).
- management of the channel and of the link (to LMP/LLP)
	- Power control, Link control (packets retransmission, sync/async link)
	- **Channel access** by using **time division duplex (TDD)**
- Error correction
^1623395938579

##### Logical transport types
#card #low-priority 
They are **abstraction over the physical channel**
- Asynchronous Connection-Oriented (**ACL**)
	- BR/EDR or LE if piconet
	- a slave can respond or not
- Advertising broadcast (**ADVB**)
	- LE for advertisers
	- there are no ACK, so **unreliable** and **unidirectional**
- Synchronous Connection-Oriented (**SCO**)
	- BR/EDR
	- slots are reserved for the master/slave communication (e.g. audio stream)
- Extended Synchronous Connection-Oriented (**eSCO**)
- Broadcast, can be used to sync the slaves
	- Active Slave Broadcast (**ASB**)
	- Parked Slave Broadcast (**PSB**)
^1623395938587

##### BR/EDR

###### Channel access
#card #exam
![[bluetooth channel access br edr.png]]
- channel divided with TDD in slots of 625Î¼s each
- master $m$ uses odd slots, slave uses even slots for the master/slave communication
- master $m$ chooses the frequency $f(k)$ in the pseudo-random sequence generated previously
- $m$ transmit first and the slave $s1$ receives in a time-slot of 625Î¼s but the packet duration is less than 392Î¼s, because the remaining is used to switch the frequency of the channel
- $s1$ only can respond in $f(k+1)$
- in $f(k+2)$, it could be that $m$ sends to $s1$ or even another $s_n$
^1623395938596

###### States
#card
Bluetooth is organized as a state machine. There several sub-states, but the major one are where the devices spent most of the time:
- **STANDBY**
	- It is the initial state of devices, not yet in the piconet
	- may be in low-power mode
- **CONNECTION**
	- in the piconet, so now master or slave and can exchange packets
	- may go in low-power mode
- **PARK** (the device is in the piconet)
	- device is in the piconet, but only remain synchronized to the channel (keep receiving broadcasts)
	- Allow a very low duty cycle
^1623395938604

Transitions among the states
#card #exam 
![[bluetooth state tranisition.png]]
- page, inquiry used to implement dynamic connection to the network
- STANDBY -> *Page scan*, if a slave is searching for a piconet
- STANDBY -> *Page*, if a master is available to receive connections for a piconet
	- looks for devices in *Page scan*, when they detect each other the master switches to *master response*, the slave  switches to *slave response*, where the master sends the parameters (clock, hopping sequence) 
	- then they switch to CONNECTION where they communicate
- CONNECTION <-> PARKED, can be done by the salve sometimes
- The discovery of devices can be implemented with
	- STANDBY -> *Inquiry*, discover other devices is the piconet by sending messages
	- STANDBY -> *Inquiry scan*, if a device want to be discovered by listening to *inquiry* messages. It can optionally answer by sending back device parameters (address, name, supported services...)
^1623395938613

###### Connection state sub-states
#card
	- ![[bluetooth connection state sub-states.png]]
	- Active mode, normal master/slave communication where the slave can optionally go to PARK STATE
	- Switching between active, sniff and hold is fast because address is the same
^1623395938623

**Sniff mode**
#card #exam
- to reduce the duty cycle to save energy. The slave tells the master it will communicate only in a given specific slots that are smaller than all the available slots.
- it supports both sync/async
- ![[bluetooth sniff mode duty cycle.png]]
	- duty cycle of the activate state is represented by all the slots divided with black horizontal line
	- slave require to switch to sniff mode and agrees with the master a **sniff interval** divided by the **sniff anchor point** that defines the slot where the slave is available to receive communication
	- it responds in the immediately after slots
^1623395938632

**Sniff mode duty cycle**
#card
![[bluetooth sniff mode duty cycle.png]]
Considering a device operating in sniff mode in a Bluetooth piconet. What is the duty cycle the device, assuming that it may both receive and send to the master at each anchor point? 
- Note: consider only the duty cycle of the radio, disregard any other activity and assume the radio has to remain on for the entire duration of a slot.
- Hint: a slot in Bluetooth lasts 625 msec, although you can compute the duty cycle without this information
- <details>
 <summary>ANSWER</summary>
 50%
</details>
^1623395938641

**Hold mode**
#card
acts like Sniff mode but only synchronous communication is possible
- if in two piconets, it can be used to make attend one of them
- to enter in low power mode
^1623395938649

**Park mode**
#card
- gives away the address and communication is not possible anymore
- actively listen for sync messages from the master
^1623395938658

##### LE

###### Advertising/scanning mechanism
#card #exam
![[bluetooth le advertising scanning.png]]
- devices uses just the last 3 channels (37, 38, 39)
- the advertiser publish an event all over the 3 channels
- a scanner can optionally respond on the same channel by asking more information, the advertiser then respond again
^1623395938666

###### Piconet initialization
#card
![[bluetooth le connection initialization.png]]
- An **advertiser** issues a connectable advertising event
- The **initiator**, that is a **scanner** that is available to become the **master**, receives the event and starts the connection protocol by sending back the parameters (initiator rectangle, second from left)
- The **initiator** becomes the **master** of the piconet
- The **advertiser** becomes the **slave**
^1623395938675

###### Roles
#card
A Bluetooth LE device can operate in four different device roles. Depending on
the role, the devices behave differently.
- connection-based, acts like BR/EDR but only asynchronous communication
	- A **Peripheral device** is a **connectable advertiser** that can operate as a **slave** in a connection (e.g. a health thermometer or a heart rate sensor).
	- A **Central (initiator) device** scans for advertisers and initiate connections. It operates as a **master** in one or more connections (e.g. smartphones and computers).
- connection-less (one-directional communication), async communication with advertising events (*beacons*) over a physical link to *all* scanners
	- A **Broadcaster** is a **non-connectable advertiser** (e.g. a temperature sensor or an electronic tag).
	- An **Observer (scanner)** scans for advertisements, but cannot initiate connections (e.g. a remote display or a tracking system).
- a flag is used to indicate weather is connectable or not
^1623395938683

###### States
#card
![[bluetooth states le.png]]
- based on the role that the device takes, it will take a subset of the following states
- **Observer scanner**: it will switch between *scanning* and *standby* in order to have a low duty cycle
- **Central initiator device**: as the observer but when it wants to create the network it will go the the *initiating* in order to see if there are available slaves, and then *connection*
- **Broadcaster**: switches between *advertising* and *standby*
- **Peripheral device (slave)**: as the broadcaster, but when the initiator responds with parameters, it will switch to *connection*<->*standby*
^1623395938692

##### Addresses

###### MAC
#card
MAC address: IEEE 48 bits:
- **BR/EDR**: pre-assigned (24 bits company name, 24 bits company ID)
- **LE**: Randomly generated (slave in a piconet) or pre-assigned (if advertiser, 24 bits company name, 24 bits company ID)

###### Piconet network
#card
Network addresses in the piconet
- **Active Member** address: 3 bits for active slaves, 0 for broadcast.
- **Parked Member** address: 8 bits

#### LMP/LLP (Data link - lower part)
#card
It's the **link manager layer** that controls and negotiates the connections with the slaves
- roles
	- piconet management (clock sync, switch master/slave)
	- setup [[#Logical transport types]]
	- link configuration (create, QoS)
- protocols:
	- Link Management Protocol (LMP) for BR/EDR
	- Link Layer Protocol (LLP) for BLE

#### Host Controller Interface
#card
It's just a serial communication interface that allows the SW (host) to use the HW (controllers), 
- **firmware** (controller), implement commands to access HW
- **driver** (host), manages the async events
- host controller transport layer, layer in between the previous two

#### L2CAP (Data link - upper part) 
#card
Logical link control and adaptation protocol 
- services
	- **protocol multiplex/demultiplex**, when a frame arrives from HW it needs to decide to which application protocol it must be delivered
	- **segmentation/reassembly** for data that is too long for a frame
	- Manages QoS and group communication
- no transmission of audio, no retransmission -> no reliability

#### RFCOMM (Application core)
#card
Protocol that emulates serial line 

#### Audio (Application core)
#card
No ACK because audio streams are in real time, so time would be wasted but correction with bits can be made

#### TCS (Application)
#card
Protocol to initiate calls

#### AT (Application)
#card
Protocol to control modem and phones

#### OBEX (Application)
#card 
Object exchange protocol

#### ATT/GATT/GAP (Application core)
#card
Acts like the cluster library in [[ZigBee]])
- **Attribute Protocol (ATT)**, defines access methods to the services in order to expose the state by showing attributes of the server to the client
	- attribute: identified with UUID or local name, permissions (read/write)
	- operations: get/set, push/pull (for sensors to obtain a simple **publish/subscribe**), broadcast
	- optional for BR/EDR
- **Generic Access Profile (GAP)** defines a list of protocols that any device should implement in order to support for a specific configuration **(what)**
	- For example: BR/EDR should have audio, baseband, LMP, L2CAP, SDP,
- **Generic Attribute Profile (GATT)** defines a profile for a service that is the list of attributes that provides
	- **service**: a collection of data and associated behaviors to accomplish a function of the device
		- is accepts ATT requests 
		- e.g. computer (client) - temperature sensor (server)
	- optional for BR/EDR
-   are supported by the device, because Bluetooth devices have same host, but the controllers are just a subset of all the possible one that can be implemented

#### SDP (Application core)
#card
Service discovery by asking to the server the available services and the attributes
- based on a client/server model by searching with a service UUID or get the whole list of services
- simpler than [[ZigBee]], because it's a start network


#### SMP
Security management protocol uses the L2CAP channel for the
- pairing of devices (key generation, distribution)

## Security

### Goals
#card
Protections against
-  passive eavesdropping;
-  man-in-the-middle attacks;

### Access model
#card
Pair a device with a piconet if they not share a key for mutual authentication (no crypto keys). Different types depending on the device's capabilities:
- **just works**
	- security is given intrinsically by the low range of devices (e.g. earbuds)
	- usually there is no display
- **numeric comparison**
	- display is needed to show a 6 digit number and let the user  check weather it's the same on both devices
	- here the alternative channel is the human
- **out of band**
	- other channels (no bluetooth) to transfer the cryptographic codes
- **passkey entry**
	- one device with input and one with output capability. e.g. computer and bluetooth keyboard that needs to be paired


### Secure pairing BR/EDR

#### 1. Cryptographic keys
For the link-level security the following elements are needed:
- **BD_ADDR**, 48 bit
	- this can be easily eavesdropped with inquiry
- **Private key authentication (link key)**, 128 bit
	- obtained during initialization
	- semi-permanent or temporary (only one session of connection between master/slave)
- **Private key encryption**, 8-128 bit
	- the one used to encrypt
	- renewed at every session obtained from the authentication 
- **Random n**, 128 bit

#### 2. Authentication
Implemented at [[#LMP LLP Data link - lower part|LMP]] layer to authenticate two devices when the slave wanna-be joins the network
- **mutual authentication**, first one direction and then the other one
- **mechanisms**
	- common link key
	- not have a common link key and they need to build it with a PIN

##### Common link key
#card #exam
![[Bluetooth authentication common link key.png]]
Also called challenge/response mechanism
1. There are the verifier $v$ and the climant $c$
2. $c$ makes the request to $v$ to be authenticated
3. $v$ generates random number (**challenge**)
4. both of them know the Link key and the BD_ADDR of $c$
5. $c$ receives the challenge and computes the ACO (Athenticated Cyphering Offset, namely the encryption key)
6. $c$ sends the **response** to $v$
$v$ verifies and respond
7. if they match, now they share the same encryption key

#### 3. Encryption
#card
![[bluetooth encryption key .png]]

### Secure pairing BLE
Requirements are totally different than [[#Secure pairing BR EDR]], because computational power is less

#### Privacy
To reduce the possibility of being tracked as a BLE device, the MAC can be changed frequently
- in order to being recognized by the "right" devices, the binding is done with private addresses

## Comparisons 
![[bluetooth vs other protocols.png]]
- bluetooth SCO/eSCO is the synchronized one used by BR/EDR

### ZigBee
Compared to [[ZigBee]]
- Bluetooth is widely available in different kind of devices, [[ZigBee]] is constrained over IoT devices
- Beginning of 2000 there was the need in the E-health sector and [[IEEE 802.15.4]] was not even there
- Only start topology
- Technically multi-hop is doable, but not known use-cases
- A device can switch between master/slave role
